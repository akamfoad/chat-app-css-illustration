# Chat app CSS illustration

This is my solution to the [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/chat-app-css-illustration-O5auMkFqY "chat app css illustration") challenge.
I made it with **HTML5** and **vanilla CSS**.
It's responsive across devices from Large desktops to small mobile screens.
